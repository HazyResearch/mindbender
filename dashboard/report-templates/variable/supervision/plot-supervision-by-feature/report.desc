Scatter plot that shows an overview of the supervised labels by feature.
Each bubble corresponds to one of the most frequently extracted features.
X and Y axes show the number positive and negative candidates per feature, respectively.
The size of the bubble indicates how many unsupervised candidates have the feature.
Ideally, there should be a variety of features distributed on every side of the plot.
