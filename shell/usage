# > usage TOOLPATH [MESSAGE]...
# 
# The first block of comments in TOOLPATH (i.e., the lines that start with `# `
# excluding the first she-bang line) will be shown as the usage of the tool.
# The block is terminated with a `#`-line that has no trailing space.
# 
# Any comment in the block beginning with `> ` or `$ ` will be shown without the
# leading hash (`#`).  All other non-empty lines will keep their leading hash.
# Therefore, it is recommended to prefix shell commands, or code for the user
# to literally copy with these marker characters.
# 
# When a MESSAGE is given, it will be shown as error.  It's a good practice to
# specify the reason why the usage is being displayed using the same texts.
